# NestNotes üìù

A simple, efficient, and user-friendly note-taking application built with the power of the NestJS framework.

-----

## About The Project

NestNotes is a backend service for a note-taking application designed to be robust, scalable, and easy to maintain. It leverages the modular architecture of **NestJS**, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and reliable server-side applications. The project provides a complete set of APIs for creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes (CRUD operations).

This project serves as a practical example of building RESTful APIs with NestJS, incorporating best practices like data validation, database integration with Prisma, and a clean code structure.

## Features ‚ú®

  * **CRUD Operations**: Full support for creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes.
  * **RESTful API**: A well-structured and predictable API for easy integration with any frontend.
  * **Data Validation**: Built-in validation using class-validator to ensure data integrity.
  * **Database Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with a database using the **Prisma** ORM.
  * **Scalable Architecture**: Built on the modular architecture of NestJS, making it easy to extend and maintain.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your machine:

  * **Node.js** (v18 or later recommended)
  * **npm** or **yarn**
  * **A database** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) supported by Prisma.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sharkyyyx28/NestNotes.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd NestNotes
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    or if you use yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your database connection URL:

    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="your_database_connection_string"
    ```

5.  **Run database migrations:**
    Apply the database schema using Prisma Migrate.

    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the application in different modes.

  * **Development mode:**
    This command starts the application with hot-reloading enabled.

    ```bash
    npm run start:dev
    ```

  * **Production mode:**
    First, build the project:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    Then, run the compiled application:

    ```bash
    npm run start:prod
    ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. You can use an API client like Postman or Insomnia to interact with the endpoints.
